Recently we made up stories of a game connected to octocat. Inspiration came to me fast, when I saw sticker that we were given (thanks a lot, Sherol), Octocat on this sticker was kind of spy (like on the picture above). And Lyalya who is in my team invented Dog-Shark and then Anvar (thank you so much) suggested to give a name Dark, then we created Ratbug and Delphycat. So in our world all animals have extraordinary names. I was absolutely lucky to be in a group with Ulpan cause she is amazing artist! 
Also my special thanks to Ayman, our first guest speaker for such a helpful conversation and giving advices!
