Today we had such a great experience with arduino. I'm sure everybody including me fell in love with ARDUINO UNO. 

The UNO is the best board to get started with electronics and coding. If this is your first experience tinkering with the platform, the UNO is the most robust board you can start playing with. The UNO is the most used and documented board of the whole Arduino & Genuino family.
