But 30 stages...

Rules of play: there is ony one character- cute elephant. By moving him you can jump and do to neighbouring blocks. On some stages you are expected to use mouse insted of keys. You shouldn't jump on the place where there are thorns.

Winning conditions: 1)if you are able to go the next stage; 2)if you have finished all stages.
 
Story: The elephant forgot the rest of the levels, but luckily he still has one left!

Actually I liked this game the most, I couldn't stop playing it so I recomment it to you [try](http://www.onemorelevel.com/game/there_is_only_one_level)
