![_config.yml](https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/09/august/onlyliveonce.jpg)

Rules of play: you have one character-player, a man. Use keys on keyboard to move him.

Winning conditions: I died after 2 minutes playing this game so it seems I'll never know how to win but I think if you are alive you are already winner.

Story: one man wants to save a woman that he knows and goes to a castle where he probably dies.
