Today our guest speaker was one of the best game designer Stone Librande! He is one of the most popular and successful game designers and designer of one of my favourite game- Sim City! Also he is designer of the famous games such as Diablo 3, Spore, Simpsons, and etc.

I really enjoyed our conversation and now I have more information about game design so it became much easier to me to choose my future job.

That's great that he appreciates his job and he is really hard-worker, his attention on his work amazed me! 

Good luck in your career, Mr Stone!
