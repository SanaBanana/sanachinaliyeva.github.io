Today we had guest speaker from Kyrgyzstan - Chinara Satkeeva. She works in a google as a technical manager and as I understood, she enjoys her job.

It was really important conversation cause she gave us some advices and explained what is really momentous and how to get job,how to build your future and etc. 

Also now I know how I should behave if I go abroad cause our cultures and nations are very similar and my opinion quiet changed.

Communication is actually the most important thing, this words were said by Sherol several times, by Arash, professor from AlmaU, by Mr Stone, by Ms Ayman and finally Chinara proved it on her own example.

Thank you so much! Good luck!
